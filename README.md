# ToDoList

Create your ToDoList!: https://nice-pink-coypu-kilt.cyclic.app/

## What is It?

This project is a full-stack ToDoList web application that showcases my expertise in both frontend and backend development. With a focus on creating a seamless user experience, I developed the application following my personal brand guidelines and utilized GitHub for version control.

The web app allows users to create and manage task groups with ease. Using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, I set up a server to handle routing and rendering of different pages. MongoDB Atlas, integrated with Mongoose, serves as the database for securely storing tasks. Additionally, I created a GitHub repository to safely update and make changes to the web app, ensuring a streamlined development process.

## How I did It?

Through the Cyclic deployment platform, I deployed the web app, making it accessible to users. Adding a custom task group is as simple as typing /[TASK GROUP NAME] at the end of the URL, enabling users to create personalized task groups. Specific tasks added to a custom group are stored exclusively within that group and are not displayed in other groups.

For the frontend development, I designed visually appealing and responsive elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The seamless integration of frontend and backend components ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across the ToDoList web app.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project highlights my proficiency in full-stack development, encompassing frontend design, server setup using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, integration with MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose for data storage, deployment via Cyclic, and the use of a GitHub repository for version control. The ToDoList web app empowers users to efficiently manage tasks through dynamic task groups, providing a flexible and organized task management system.
